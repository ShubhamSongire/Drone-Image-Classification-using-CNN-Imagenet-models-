# Drone-Image-Classification-using-CNN-Imagenet-models-
This is deep learning image classification model. I have classified dataset using imagent's different classification models. I have taken the imagenet models and finetuned them to fit my dataset. changed first layer accordingly our dataset and given proper parameters to train deep learning neural network model. 
link of dataset for this project is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zglFJPmfcbVIsIg4SwchuR2fLWCZvqjP?usp=sharing
